    <h1>Plant Diseases</h1>
    <p>Plant disease is defined as the state of local or systemic abnormal physiological functioning of a plant,
        resulting from the continuous, prolonged 'irritation' caused by phytopathogenic organisms (infectious or biotic
        disease agents).</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Water Pollution</h2>
    <p>Water pollution is the contamination of water sources by substances which make the water unusable for drinking,
        cooking, cleaning, swimming, and other activities. Pollutants include chemicals, trash, bacteria, and parasites.
        All forms of pollution eventually make their way to water.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Soil Pollution</h3>
    <p>Soil pollution refers to the contamination of soil with anomalous concentrations of toxic substances. It is a
        serious environmental concern since it harbours many health hazards. For example, exposure to soil containing
        high concentrations of benzene increases the risk of contracting leukaemia.</p>

    <h4>Air Pollution</h4>
    <p>Air pollution is a mixture of solid particles and gases in the air. Car emissions, chemicals from factories,
        dust, pollen and mold spores may be suspended as particles. Ozone, a gas, is a major part of air pollution in
        cities.</p>
    <h5>Land Pollution</h5>
    <p>Land pollution refers to the deterioration of the earth's land surfaces, at and below ground level. The cause is
        the accumulation of solid and liquid waste materials that contaminate groundwater and soil.</p>
    <h6>Sound Pollution</h6>
    <p>Noise pollution is an invisible danger. It cannot be seen, but it is present nonetheless, both on land and under
        the sea. Noise pollution is considered to be any unwanted or disturbing sound that affects the health and
        well-being of humans and other organisms. Sound is measured in decibels.</p>
